```

## Documentation

Sentry has extensive documentation for this SDK.

Check the Sentry [Unity documentation for more details](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/unity/).


## Preview Demo

A video explaining the project and showing the early support:

## Legacy SDK

If you are using Unity 5.6 or building WebGL players, these are not supported by this SDK. WebGL support will be added later, but there are no plans to support versions of Unity older than **2018.1**.

Sentry offered a minimalistic but stable SDK called [_sentry-unity-lite_](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity-lite). It's available on a different repository. That SDK is now deprecated but is still compatible with Sentry server.
