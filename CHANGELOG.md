# Changelog

## 1.0.0

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed `OptionsConfiguration` to `RuntimeOptionsConfiguration` on the ScriptableSentryOptions ([#1196](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity/pull/1196))\
    If you make use of programmatic runtime options configuration, you will need to reassign the scriptable object in the configuration tab
- Renamed `SentryBuildtimeOptionsConfiguration` to `SentryBuildTimeOptionsConfiguration` ([#1187](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity/pull/1187))\
    If you make use of the programmatic build time configuration, you will need to update your implementation with the base class
- Removed `Override Sentry URL` from editor window ([#1188](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity/pull/1188))\
    The option is still available from within the `SentryBuildTimeOptionsConfiguration`

### Fixes

- The SDK no longer logs a warning due to a missing log file on non-windows player platforms ([#1195](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity/pull/1195))
- Preventing `LoggingIntegration` from registering multiple times ([#1178](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity/pull/1178))
- Fixed the logging integration only capturing tags and missing the message ([#1150](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity/pull/1150))

### Features

- Added Performance Integration options to editor window ([#1198](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity/pull/1198))
- Much improved line numbers for IL2CPP builds by setting the `instruction_addr_adjustment` appropriately ([#1165](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity/pull/1165))
- Added ANR options to the editor window and made ANR timeout accessible on the options object ([#1181](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity/pull/1181))
