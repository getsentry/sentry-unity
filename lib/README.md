`gson` is a dependency of Sentry Android and is planned to be removed.

While it is still a dependency, we'll copy from here when assembling the Unity package in combination with the Sentry SDK for Android.

From: https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/google/code/gson/gson/2.8.5/gson-2.8.5.jar

[Version defined in buildSrc](src/sentry-java/buildSrc/src/main/java/Config.kt)
