# Unity of Bugs

This sample will not load up on Unity just by pulling the repositoru.
Its goal is to help engineers built the Sentry SDK for Unity, and to get it running you need to build the project first.
That's documented in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

You can access the sample scenes of this project without building this project though. It's [bundled in the released Sentry UPM package](https://github.com/getsentry/unity).
During the installation process, in the Unity package manager, you'll see the sample scene that's bundled in the package.
