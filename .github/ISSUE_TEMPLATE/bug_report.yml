        How do you use Sentry?
        Sentry SaaS (sentry.io) or self-hosted/on-premise (which version?)

        Which version of the SDK?

        How did you install the package? (Git-URL, Assetstore)

        Which version of Unity?

        Is this happening in Unity (editor) or on a player like Android, iOS, Windows?
